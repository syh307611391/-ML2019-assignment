It also compares the performance of some different methods on handwritten digit recognition task. In order to build a system which can recognise the patterns like digits and characters with relying more on automatic learning instead of hand-designed heuristics, LeCun et al. described and evaluated two different systems for online handwriting recognition.\n",

In order to achieve this goal, the authors firstly evaluate the traditional pattern recognition, which consists two main modules, one is called feature extractor and the other is classifier, and they believe that the accuracy of this method is highly depend on the ability of designer and the set of features. In this research paper, LeCun et al. mainly focus on the system of handwriting recognition, and they illustrate that the challenges of the handwriting recognition are not only to recognise the characters themselves, but also to separate those recognised characters and interpret them into words and sentences.\n",

The first layer, which is known as Layer C1, has 6 feature maps and each one is connected to a 5x5 neighbourhood in the input. The next layer is Layer S2, which is a sub-sampling layer and has 4 14x14 feature maps, this layer is connected to a 2x2 neighbourhood in C1. Layer C3 is the third layer with 16 feature maps, and each unit is connected to S2 feature maps. The following layers are similar with the upper layers, they are connected to the next layers. Finally, the output layer is composed of Euclidean Radial Basis Function(LeCun et al. 1998; LeCun et al. 1995).\n",

LeCun et al. discovered that, however, SD-3 was almost different from SD-1, because SD-3 was much cleaner, so they decided to generate a new database based on the SD-3 and SD-1. What they did was to mix the NIST’s datasets, and finally they named the resulting database as the Modified NIST dataset. Moreover, LeCun et al. used three different versions of MNIST database in order to improve the performance of those recognition methods. The first version is regular database, while the second is deslanted database, and the images in third version are 16x16 pixels(LeCun et al. 1998).\n",

The GTN systems they introduced can better solve such limitation and deficiency.\n"

It provides many detailed explanations about both LeNet-5 and GTN, and offers a plenty of comparison experiments, which include many related methods. For some explanations of the LeNet-5, it uses the introduction of Convolutional Neural Network as complement to help readers have a better understanding of LeNet-5. And in the experiment part, it not only just focuses on the results of the comparison, but also it introduces briefly about some methods in the experiments, for example, LeNet-1, LeNet-4 and Boosted LeNet-4, which are also performs well in character recognition. Moreover, it gives many examples of the characters in the database used, which can make the paper more convincing about why use MNIST as the dataset.\n",

        "In this paper, the authors describe and explain two applications, one is on-line handwriting recognition and the other is GTN based check reading system. For the on-line handwriting recognition system, they built it based on four major modules: a pre-processor designed for determine a word or word group; a module used for capture the trajectory of the pen-based devices; a convolutional neural network for character recognition; a GTN system to interpret the output of the network. For the second application they describe, they evaluate the improvement of the check reading system based on GTN methodology: firstly, the data trained by the recognizer becomes bigger; secondly, due to the GTN, the new system take the grammar constraints into consideration, so that the accuracy perform better than previously; lastly, GTN methodology is more flexible in terms of testing heuristics, adjusting parameters and tuning the system.\n",
        "For more application based one the technology that this research introduced, I think, it can be applied in the license plate number identification, which plays an important role in many real-life scenarios, for example, the car parking system, monitoring system(Wei et al. 2019). For the car license plate number, the characters on it is simple and normalized, so the implementation can be quite easy, and the result can be very accurate, but the most challenge issue we need to solve is the time for recognition. And for the monitoring system, the image of the car plate number that the monitor captured can be not very clear and may cause some distortion because of the limitation of the camera pixel, so it will require much more distortion images of characters as training set to develop the recognizer. More than that, I think this method can be also used for the recognition of Chinese characters.\n"
